## What is CONTEXT Builder?

CONTEXT Builder is a CLI tool that helps developers prepare their codebase as context for AI assistants. When working with AI-powered IDEs or co-pilots, your code needs to be formatted properly to be understood by AI tools. However, if you prefer to stick with your favorite code editor rather than switching to an AI-powered IDE, preparing this context manually can be tedious and time-consuming.

CONTEXT Builder solves this problem by automatically converting your codebase into a format that's optimized for AI consumption. Once prepared, you can easily upload this context to your favorite AI tool (like ChatGPT, Claude, or others) and start asking questions about your code, getting suggestions, or debugging issuesâ€”all without leaving your preferred development environment.

## Installation

Install CONTEXT Builder globally using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm i -g @json-express/context-builder
```

## Usage

Navigate to your project directory and run the tool:

```bash
cd project-dir
context-builder
```

The tool will process your codebase and generate the context file (`project-context.txt`) that you can upload to your AI assistant.

## Uninstallation

To remove CONTEXT Builder from your system:

```bash
pnpm uninstall -g @json-express/context-builder
```
